# Implementation of Hierarchical Temporal Memory
Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) is a biologically constrained theory of machine intelligence originally described in the 2004 book On Intelligence[1] by Jeff Hawkins with Sandra Blakeslee. HTM is based on neuroscience and the physiology and interaction of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex of the human brain. The technology has been tested and implemented in software through example applications from Numenta and commercial applications from Numentaâ€™s partners.
